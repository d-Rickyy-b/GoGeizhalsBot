# GoGeizhalsBot
This repository holds a rewrite of my [Python-GeizhalsBot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/Python-GeizhalsBot) Telegram bot in Go. 
A bot to get notified on Telegram about changes of the price of a [geizhals.de](https://geizhals.de) product or wishlist.

## Configuration
The software searches for a config.yml file in the current working directory.
Check [config.sample.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/GoGeizhalsBot/master/config.sample.yml) for an example.
